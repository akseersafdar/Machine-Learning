Hyper-parameters are parameters that are not directly learnt within estimators. In scikit-learn they are
passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. Typical examples include C, kernel and gamma for
Support Vector Classifier, alpha for Lasso, etc.

It is possible and recommended to search the hyper-parameter space for the best cross validation score.

Any parameter provided when constructing an estimator may be optimized in this manner. Specifically, to find
the names and current values for all parameters for a given estimator.
