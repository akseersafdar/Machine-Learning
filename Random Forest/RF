Random Forest Algorithm
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and 
other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that
is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision
forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.

In this exercise we will try to predict if a customer would default or Not. Credit Card is a very
important product for banks and it is crucial for them to know in advance if a customer is likely to default
on credit card payments. We will clean the data first and then would tune the hyper parameter for final prediction model.
