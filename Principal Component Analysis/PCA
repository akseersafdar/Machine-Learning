Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert 
a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) 
into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. If there are n observations 
with p variables, then the number of distinct principal components is min(n-1,p). This transformation is defined 
in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much
of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible 
under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear 
combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. 
PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.
